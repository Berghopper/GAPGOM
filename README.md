# ABOUT #

GAPGOM (novel **G**ene **A**nnotation **P**rediction and other **GO** **M**etrics) is an R package containing various tools and algorithms for semantic distance/comparison calculations and various other measures needed to predict annotation of gene functions of an unkown gene. This is done with comparing them to other known genes (guilt by association).
