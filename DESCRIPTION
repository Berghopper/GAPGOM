Description: Collection of various measures and tools for lncRNA annotation prediction put inside a redistributable R package. The package contains two main algorithms; lncRNA2GOA and TopoICSim. lncRNA2GOA tries to annotate novel genes (in this specific case lncRNAs) by using various correlation/geometric scoring methods on correlated expression data. After correlating/scoring, the results are annotated and enriched. TopoICSim is a topologically based method, that compares gene similarity based on the topology of the GO DAG by information content (IC) between GO terms.
